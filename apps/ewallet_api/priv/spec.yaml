  title: TOKEN PLAY BACKEND API
  description: >
    This is the documentation for Token Play Backend API. [Token Play Backend Architecture Figure](http://app.blocplays.com/tokenplay_arch.png).
    
    # Application
    
    The Decentralized App ("Dapp") consists of the following core components:
    
      * Home
      * Store
      * Messaging
      * Live Events
      * Profile
      * Wallet
      
    The goal of this API is to bring together both a `crypto wallet` and a games distribution system like `Steam` using modern web app technologies such as `ElectronJS`.
    
    
    There are several `Backends` within the Token Play environment. It is important to understand that the `eWallet Backend` is the point of entry for the Clients which are then authorized to access the `Gamer Backend` and `Payment Backend`. Game Servers and the Developer Backend may be sending data to the Gamer Backend directly. The `Gamer Backend` is responsible for communicating game related data such as player stats to the `Cassandra Database`. The `eWallet Backend` is responsible for communicating transactions and user related data to a `Postgresql Database`. 
    
    
      **Backends**
      * eWallet Backend
      * Gamer Backend
      * EVM Payment Processing Backend
      * Developer Backend
      
    # Technology
        
    The technology stack includes the following:
    
      **Client App**
      * Node.js
      * ElectronJS (App Rendering/Logic Threading)
      * React (App Rendering)
      * Phoenix Framework (Messaging)
      * Bitraider Framework (Distribution, Downloading, Streaming)
      
      **Developer App**
      * Bitraider (Uploading, Distribution, Versoning, Streaming)
      * Elixir Web App (Developer Administrator)           
      
      **Server**
      * eWallet Backend API (Account/Ledger/Transactions/Tracking)
      * Gamer API Backend (Store, Games, Stats)
      * EVM Backend (Payment processing via EVM. DEX, Fiat)
      
      **Decentralized**     
      * Peer Swarm (DHT based Game Related Data)
      * IPFS Filesystem (Store Images, Avatars, Game Packages)
      
      **Databases**      
      * Apache Cassandra (Players, Achievements, Stats)
      * Postgresql (Accounts, Transactions, Ledger)
      
      **Third party web APIs**
      * Twitch API (Streaming)    
      * YouTube API (Streaming)
      * ESL API (eSports)        
    
    # Development
    
    The preferred development operating system is `Ubuntu 16.04 LTS`.
    
    
    A `docker` file will be created of the development environment. And of course a bash script.
    
    
    Packages should be compiled from scratch on Ubuntu. Do not trust Ubuntu's apt-get dependencies.
    
    
      **Dependencies**
      * LIBSODIUM_VERSION="1.0.15"
      * YARN_VERSION="1.5.1-1"
      * NODEJS_VERSION="8.x"
      * ELIXIR_VERSION="1.6"
      
      Once the buildscript will complete `./configure && make && make install` for these packages automagically.
    
    
    **Programming Languages**
    
    
    A few thoughts on programming language choices. Our primary backend logic language of choice is `elixir`. Elixir is a dynamic, functional language designed for building scalable and maintainable applications. Elixir leverages the `Erlang VM` called `OTP` (Open Telephone Platform), known for running low-latency, distributed and fault-tolerant systems, while also being successfully used in web development and the embedded software domain. Elixir is used by companies such as Heroku, WhatsApp, and Netflix.

  
    **Endpoints**
    
    
    At the moment two kinds of endpoints can be found in this document: the `server` endpoints
    and the `client` (mobile, desktop, backend) endpoints.


    All API calls that modify the database need to be done from the server
    for security purposes, while retrieval calls can be made from the client
    (considered unsafe, `never trust the client`).


    Both server and client calls are authorized using the 'Authorization'
    HTTP header with the following format:


    - Server: Authorization=PLAYServer Base64(access_key:secret_key)

    - Client: Authorization=PLAYClient Base64(api_key:authentication_token)


    Due to HTTP-RPC nature, the API will always return a `200` HTTP status,
    including on errors. Only in case of an internal server error that `500`
    will be returned.
